# Authentication & Authorization Features Development

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks required to implement authentication and authorization features using Keycloak, including role-based access control and session management.

## Tasks

### 1. Keycloak Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Set up Keycloak container with PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure Keycloak realm and client
- [ ] Set up initial roles (admin, user)
- [ ] Create test users with different roles
- [ ] Configure client scopes and mappers
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Configure token settings (TTL, refresh tokens)

### 2. Backend Integration
- [ ] Install and configure Keycloak Node.js adapter
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware
- [ ] Create user authentication endpoints
  - [ ] Login
  - [ ] Logout
  - [ ] Token refresh
  - [ ] User info
- [ ] Implement role-based route protection
- [ ] Add user session management
- [ ] Implement token validation and verification
- [ ] Add error handling for authentication failures

### 3. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Install and configure Keycloak JavaScript adapter
- [ ] Implement login page
- [ ] Create authentication context/provider
- [ ] Add protected route components
- [ ] Implement role-based UI elements
- [ ] Add session timeout handling
- [ ] Create user profile component
- [ ] Implement token refresh logic
- [ ] Add logout functionality

### 4. Session Management
- [ ] Implement session storage strategy
- [ ] Configure session timeout
- [ ] Add session renewal mechanism
- [ ] Implement concurrent session handling
- [ ] Add session activity tracking
- [ ] Create session cleanup mechanism

### 5. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [ ] Configure secure cookie settings
- [ ] Implement password policies
- [ ] Add account lockout mechanism
- [ ] Set up audit logging for auth events

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for auth middleware
- [ ] Create integration tests for auth flow
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Test session management
- [ ] Perform security testing
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] Document authentication flow
- [ ] Create API documentation for auth endpoints
- [ ] Document role-based access control
- [ ] Add setup instructions for Keycloak
- [ ] Create user guide for authentication features

## Dependencies
- Keycloak server
- PostgreSQL database
- Node.js backend
- React frontend
- Redis (for session management)

## Security Considerations
- All sensitive data must be encrypted
- Implement proper token storage
- Use secure communication (HTTPS)
- Follow OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Use secure session management

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully authenticate
- [ ] Role-based access control works correctly
- [ ] Sessions are properly managed
- [ ] Token refresh works as expected
- [ ] All security measures are in place
- [ ] Tests pass successfully
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Notes
- Keep security best practices in mind throughout development
- Regular security reviews should be conducted
- Monitor for any security vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow the principle of least privilege
